# Flocking Simulator

An implementation of Boids Flocking Algorithm using Java.

## Boids Flocking Algorithm Rules

**1. Alignment**  
Boids will try to align themselves with the Boids around them. This allows them to fly in the same direction.
    
**2. Cohesion**  
Boids will try to stay close to the Boids around them. This reduces the chance of Boids being separated from the groups.
    
**3. Separation**  
Boids will try to avoid collisions with other Boids. This allows the Boids to fly near each other without overlapping.
